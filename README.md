# -Deep-learning-based-Human-Activity-Recognition
The objective of this study is to automatically 
detect different human activities (9 Activities). The data is taken from locally collected data using smart phone body 
sensor. Under this work ML models and deep learning models including CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM are compered.  Although the models achived better results on well structured local data the result put here are genereated from sample data.  
The 9 activities include: 
        1: 'sitting',
        2: 'standing',
        3: 'cycling',
        4: 'running',
        5: 'upstairs',
        6: 'downstairs',
        7: 'walking',
        8: 'jumping',
        9: 'situp'
  In addition the file named featureEngineeringandMLtest contain some feature enginnering application to train a classical machine learning models and the training results.
